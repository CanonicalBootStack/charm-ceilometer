summary: Openstack measures collection system

description: |
 Ceilometer project aims to become the infrastructure to collect measurements 
 within OpenStack so that no two agents would need to be written to collect 
 the same data. It's primary targets are monitoring and metering, but the 
 framework should be easily expandable to collect for other needs. To that 
 effect, Ceilometer should be able to share collected data with a variety of consumers.
